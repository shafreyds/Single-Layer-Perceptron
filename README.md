# Single-Layer-Perceptron
Implementing a Single layer Perceptron for a Regression Problem

This code creates a class Perceptron that initializes the weights to zeros and has methods for the activation function, prediction, and fitting. The activation function is simply the identity function since we are solving a regression problem.

The fit method performs stochastic gradient descent for the specified number of iterations. The predict method computes the output using the dot product of the weights and the input features.
